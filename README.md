#This is a Texas Hold'em game. 
#The game only focus on important inputs and outputs via keyboard and screen, all text information, containing no graphical elements.
#You play against 5 computer players.
#Game flow is designed the same as the real world game, considering all possible player behaviors. 
#The computer player makes decisons to fold/call/raise based on ratios of odds and winning-rate, and the winning-rate is calculated by running Monte Carlo simulations.
#The computer also has a complex algorithm for deciding whether to bluff, and if bluff, what's the exact moves.
#No behavior is completely predictable, since a random constant number is involved in every decision making process for the computer player.
HAVE FUN!
